# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

In Terminal, navigate to the project root directory. Then run docker-compose up. To check if the backend is running and able to connect to your local database, point your browser to: http://localhost:3000/api/ping

To check the frontend and make sure it's connected to the backend, create a new user at: http://localhost:3001/register

Run all scripts on one of the container created by docker-compose up. Use docker exec to run commands on a running container.
